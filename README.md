# 👋 Hey!

I'm Ethan, a Computer Science student (University of London, Goldsmiths) with a strong interest in full-stack development with a focus on backend engineering, cloud, and cybersecurity.

I enjoy building clear, structured solutions and strengthening my technical foundations through real projects and continuous learning.

**I'm currently working on** deepening my knowledge in API design, cloud & DevOps fundamentals, and the security principles that support backend systems.

My current **tech stack** includes Python, JavaScript/Node.js, SQL, and C++.

I'm still exploring different technologies to find the one stack that fits my programming style the best!


## 🌍 What I’m aiming for

* Backend engineering roles (Python/Go/Node)
* Cloud-focused full stack or infrastructure internships
* Environments where clarity, structure, and strong engineering practices matter
